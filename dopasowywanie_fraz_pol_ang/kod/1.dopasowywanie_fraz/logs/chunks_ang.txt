100,61. USD JPY broke 100,95 support. USD JPY is in a consolidation after the last bearish movement. The volatility decreases. Bollinger bands are tightened. ForexTrend 4H (Mataf Trend Indicator) is in a bearish configuration. The price should continue to move in 99,40 / 100,95 range. We won't take a position. The risk/reward ratio is too high to take a position.
